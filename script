Create TABLE test AS
SELECT
active_users.month,
active_users.country,
webroleid,
active_users,
adspend,
order_type,
amount,
number_payments
FROM active_users
INNER JOIN adspend_data
ON active_users.month = adspend_data.month
INNER JOIN revenue_data
ON adspend_data.month = adspend_data.month;

---

select Country, COUNT(*) AS Number 
from test 
Group by country;

---

select order_type, COUNT(*) AS Number 
from test 
Group by order_type;

---

select country, SUM(adspend)   
from test 
Group by country;

---

Export table as csv file
---

select SUM(amount)   
from test 
;

select

from
  (select
     month, adspend, country,
     rank() OVER (
            PARTITION BY country
            ORDER BY country DESC
        )
        FROM test
        WHERE amount < 15000
    ) rank_filter WHERE RANK = 1;
